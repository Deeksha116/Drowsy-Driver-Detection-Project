# Drowsy-Driver-Detection-Project
I developed a Driver Drowsiness Detection system using OpenCV. The project detects signs of driver fatigue through real-time video analysis, identifying eye closure patterns. OpenCV was used for image processing and facial landmark detection. This Project enhances road safety by providing timely alerts.
